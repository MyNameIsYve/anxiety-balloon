# Anxiety Balloon

A small emotional resilience tool. When anxiety builds, click the balloon. When it bursts, a new one takes its place. The challenge is to keep all five alive as long as you can.

## How it works

- **Click the balloon** each time you feel anxious — it inflates a little
- **10 clicks** = the balloon bursts (a release, like crying)
- **5 balloons total** — each burst loses you one life
- **"I'm holding up. I'm not giving up on myself."** — click this to deflate the active balloon by 2
- Your state is saved automatically, so you pick up where you left off next time you open it
